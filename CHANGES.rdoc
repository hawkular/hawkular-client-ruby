This document describes the relevant changes between releases of the

* Fix an issue where the operations endpoint constructor expected a host to be passed, which was not.
* Add authentication to the websocket setup in Operations sub-client.
* Add a status endpoint call for the Alerts sub-client

=== V 2.0.0
* This version is compatible with hawkular-services[https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-services]
* By default no Tenant-Header is send in the requests, which is compatible with the old versions of Hawkular. However,
  if the option 'tenant' is passed when creating the client, it will be sent as the header. This is the only potentialy breaking change, because
